# Assignment3

This was possibly the most fun assignment, as it involved Javascript logic. It was an overall interesting process to determine the logic beforehand and then implement. Logic is simple, as we have not learned backend yet. If statements handle both login and quiz answers. If login information matches that of predetermined code (admin 1234) then user will be redirected to quiz site, and upon completion, js is used to show user what questiosn were wrong and what total score they got.

TO RUN:
download files and put them into VSCODE, then using an extension such the open in default browser open the login page. For login enter the information:
admin
1234
Otherwise, the submit button will shake and turn red, showing you have the incorrect login. 
Do the quiz and you will see your final score. 

Overall, Bootstrap was used to set the layout and css was used to briefly customize and allow the website to look better fit for the theme.
